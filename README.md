# Applied-Machine-Learning-Report-Files

I have included a number of Jupyter Notebooks labelled for the order that they are to be used (1, 2, 3).

I have also included the files that are created along the way within those books with the i=order below:

1)  'Retirement Raw data' being the starting file in Notebook 1
2)  'Cleaned data' being used within Notebook 1
3)  'Test - Train Modelling Data' being the output of Notebook 1 and the start of Notebook 2 to create the test/train data files
4)  X_train, X_test, y_train & y_test files are the output of Notebook 2 and the start of Notebook 3.

Some of the steps are separated out more as I am building this to help me to easily create my presentation for approcal to deploy.
